# LION_Plus_Plus

A version of the lion programming language written in C++ instead of Python3 in a bid to improve performance.


## Differences


- The C++ version will be much faster than the Python version
- The C++ version is in the process of translation from Python - it doesn't currently work
- The C++ version will have the ability for low-level memory access functions, but Python doesn't include these.
